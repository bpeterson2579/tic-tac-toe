## Personal wins

I was able to get the logic for the game to work on my own. I was anticipating that this would be really difficult, but breaking down the game into tiny steps helped tremendously.

## Personal struggles

I could not make the javascript as DRY as I would like. I tried many different methods and I couldn't get them to work properly.
I had some difficulties with localStorage as well. I wasn't aware that localStorage doesn't keep functionality of methods upon page load, so I had to refactor a bunch of stuff to get that to work.
